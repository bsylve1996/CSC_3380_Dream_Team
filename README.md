Schedulr is an online calendar tool that allows end users to interact with a calendar and maintain a schedule. Users will be able to add and delete events from their calendar, view the calendars of their contacts, and make their calendar come to life with all new color priority system!

This program should streamline planning, and make anyone who decides to use it well prepared for upcoming events, and life as well.

This system should be functional for all groups of people: managers and employees, students and professors, and anyone who needs a bit of organization in their lives.
